# Contributing to ScholarFlux

Thank you for your interest in ScholarFlux!

If you wish to contribute to our growth as a member of the team, it's important to know our aims, focus, and philosophy in data engineering and software design.

## Our Aim

Many tools exist today that can facilitate the retrieval of scientific and scholarly information, but, as far as we've seen, none provide a unified client that can integrate and orchestrate API retrieval across multiple providers.

### Enter ScholarFlux

Using modern software design principles and a focus on growth and testing, we're seeking to fill that gap. We sought to provide a single production-grade client that allows for the smooth retrieval and processing of scholarly data
from sources such as PubMed, Crossref, SpringerNature, and others, with even more to come. In doing so, we aim to provide an extensible set of tools in the process that can be useful for data engineers, researchers, data scientists, and just about anyone else who loves working with research!
## Our Philosophy

### *The Whole is Greater than the Sum of Its Parts* — Aristotle

ScholarFlux is designed to be an extensible solution that delegates responsibility in data retrieval, security, processing, and caching to components that specialize in that area. Each module, while containing vital features in the orchestration of API workflows, is designed as a distinct library in and of itself.

### Modules

- **scholar_flux.api**: The core module that integrates all other steps to produce the coordinated response retrieval and processing that gives ScholarFlux its purpose
- **scholar_flux.security**: Contains the building blocks for masking with sensitive string pattern matching with applications that can extend to future frameworks requiring security when managing secrets, API keys, and other forms of sensitive data
- **scholar_flux.data_storage**: Creates the caching and data storage backends that support the processing and preparation of response records and metadata. It defines custom implementations supporting the use of SQL, In-Memory, Redis, MongoDB based on a common class that defines how data processing cache should operate
- **scholar_flux.sessions**: Implements CachedSessionManagers that can be used to easily create and reproduce the sessions that send and cache requests
- **scholar_flux.data**: Produces the core classes and implementations used in the orchestration of response handling steps for response parsing → record extraction → data processing/transformation
- **scholar_flux.utils**: Contains the backbone of all reusable helper functions that support ScholarFlux in ways unsung, ranging from package initialization, robust configuration loading and processing utilities

The benefits of this level of modularization and separation of concerns are enormous:

1. Those who specialize in a specific area can easily contribute their area of expertise
2. Developers can easily integrate ScholarFlux utilities and its core building blocks into the open source projects of the future
3. Debugging is less of a headache, and errors can be more easily traced and resolved for faster bug fixes

## Our Focus

There are many more tools out there, but our aim is to ensure that whatever code and methods we use, they're vetted, robust, and reliable. With that in mind, let's ensure that what we use, we also understand deeply enough to teach.

As the IT, analytical, and scientific landscape changes, our aim is to ensure that each contribution tackles a key consideration in the formatting for current use and future compatibility.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Poetry (install: `curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -`)
- Git

### Setup Steps

1. **Fork and clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/scholar-flux.git
   cd scholar-flux
   ```

2. **Install all dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Install with all extras and dev dependencies
   poetry install --all-extras --with dev,testing,docs
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables** (optional but recommended for testing)
   ```bash
   # Create a .env file in the project root
   # Add your API keys (tests will work without them using mocked responses):
   # ARXIV_API_KEY=your_key_here
   # SPRINGER_NATURE_API_KEY=your_key_here
   # CROSSREF_API_KEY=your_key_here
   # CORE_API_KEY=your_key_here
   # PUBMED_API_KEY=your_key_here
   # OPEN_ALEX_API_KEY=your_key_here
   
   # See our Security Policy for best practices: SECURITY.md
   ```

4. **Run the test suite**
   ```bash
   # Run tests for your Python version
   poetry run pytest tests -rsx -vv
   
   # Or use tox to test all Python versions (3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13, optionally 3.14)
   poetry run tox
   ```

5. **Verify code quality**
   ```bash
   poetry run tox -e lint
   ```

6. **Make your changes and submit a PR!**

## Understanding Extras

ScholarFlux uses optional dependency groups for different features:

- **`database`**: SQLAlchemy, Redis, and MongoDB support for advanced caching
- **`cryptography`**: Enhanced cache encryption capabilities
- **`parsing`**: XML and YAML parsing for various API responses

### Installing Specific Extras

```bash
# Install only what you need
poetry install --extras "database cryptography"

# Install all extras (recommended for development)
poetry install --all-extras
```

**Note:** All test environments automatically install all extras to ensure comprehensive testing.

## API Keys for Testing

ScholarFlux integrates with multiple academic APIs. For full testing, you may need API keys:

### Supported APIs

- `ARXIV_API_KEY`
- `OPEN_ALEX_API_KEY`
- `SPRINGER_NATURE_API_KEY`
- `CROSSREF_API_KEY`
- `CORE_API_KEY`
- `PUBMED_API_KEY`

### Setup

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root or in `$HOME/.scholar_flux` (never commit this!)
2. Add your API keys (optional - tests use mocked responses by default)
3. Before sending a pull request, verify that, after each commit, you haven't inadvertently committed an api key: `git grep $PUBMED_API_KEY $(git rev-list --all)`
4. See our [Security Policy](SECURITY.md) for best practices on handling credentials

**Note:** All tests use mocked responses, so API keys are optional for basic development. They're only required if you're testing actual API integrations on live data from PubMed, Core, and SpringerNature.
OpenAlex, PLOS API, Crossref, and arXiv are four resources that don't, however, require API Keys and work out-of-the-box.

### Enabling Debug Logging

By default, ScholarFlux runs with minimal logging (WARNING level and above). If you need detailed logs for development or debugging:

### Method 1: Environment Variables (Recommended)

Set these before importing ScholarFlux:
```bash
export SCHOLAR_FLUX_ENABLE_LOGGING=TRUE
export SCHOLAR_FLUX_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
```

Or in your Python code:

```python
import os
os.environ["SCHOLAR_FLUX_ENABLE_LOGGING"] = "TRUE"
os.environ["SCHOLAR_FLUX_LOG_LEVEL"] = "DEBUG"

import scholar_flux
```

### Method 2: Direct Configuration

Use the `setup_logging` function directly for more fine-grained control:

```python
import logging
from scholar_flux.utils import setup_logging
from scholar_flux import masker
from scholar_flux.security import MaskingFilter

# Enable console logging only without file rotation
setup_logging(
    log_level=logging.DEBUG,
    log_file=None  # Console only
)

# Or with file rotation
setup_logging(
    log_directory="./logs", # leave blank to create and use default $HOME/.scholar_flux directory for logging
    log_file="debug.log",
    log_level=logging.DEBUG,
    logging_filter=MaskingFilter(masker), # keeps known api keys from displaying in the console
    max_bytes=10485760,  # 10MB
    backup_count=3
)
```

**Available Log Levels:** `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`

**Note:** The environment variable method is preferred for tests and CI/CD, while direct configuration is useful for custom logging requirements.

## Testing & Code Quality

ScholarFlux uses a comprehensive testing and linting setup to ensure code quality:

### Running Tests

**Quick test (current Python version):**
```bash
poetry run pytest tests -rsx -vv
```

**Test all Python versions (3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13, optionally 3.14):**
```bash
poetry run tox
```

**With coverage report:**
```bash
poetry run tox -e coverage
```

Coverage reports are generated as both terminal output and XML format in `coverage.xml`.

**GitHub Workflow Testing Locally**

For testing GitHub Actions workflows locally, users can use [`act`](https://github.com/nektos/act) if workflow functionality needs to be vetted before implementation. 

**Installation:**
```bash
# macOS
brew install act

# Linux/Windows
curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nektos/act/master/install.sh | sudo bash
```

**Important Note for CI Workflow Testing:**

When testing `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, which runs pytest for multiple Python versions in parallel, you may encounter port conflicts with Redis and MongoDB service containers. Since `act` runs all matrix jobs on your local machine (unlike GitHub Actions which uses separate VMs), the services will try to bind to the same ports.

**Solutions:**

1. **Run one Python version at a time** (recommended):
```bash
   act -W .github/workflows/ci.yml --matrix python-version:3.13
```

2. **Run sequentially instead of in parallel**:
   Temporarily modify the workflow to remove the matrix strategy

3. **Use dynamic port mapping**:
   Modify the workflow to use dynamic ports (see GitHub Actions service container documentation)

**Note:** If you run the full matrix workflow with `act` without addressing port conflicts, MongoDB and Redis tests may be skipped for all but one Python version.

For more information on `act`, see the [official documentation](https://github.com/nektos/act).


### Code Quality Checks

**Run all linting tools:**
```bash
poetry run tox -e lint
```

This runs:
- **mypy**: Type checking for type safety
- **ruff**: Fast linting and code quality checks (PEP 8 compliance)
- **interrogate**: Documentation coverage verification

**Individual tools:**
```bash
# Type checking
poetry run mypy src tests

# Linting
poetry run ruff check src tests

# Documentation coverage
poetry run interrogate src tests

# Auto-fix linting issues where possible
poetry run ruff check --fix src tests
```

### Our Quality Standards

- **Type hints**: All functions must have type annotations
- **Docstrings**: All public classes and functions must be documented (verified by interrogate)
- **Test coverage**: New features should include tests
- **PEP 8 compliance**: Code must pass ruff checks
- **Line length**: Maximum 120 characters (configured in pyproject.toml)
- **Security**: Follow guidelines in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for handling sensitive data
