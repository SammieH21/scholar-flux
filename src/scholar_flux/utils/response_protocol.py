# /utils/response_protocol.py
"""
The scholar_flux.utils.response_protocol module is used to ensure that responses can be successfully
duck-typed and implemented without favoring a specific client such as `requests` (or by extension, `requests_cache`),
`httpx`, or `asyncio`.

An object is then seen as response-like if it passes the preliminary check of having all of the following attributes:
    - url
    - status_code
    - raise_for_status
    - headers

To ensure compatibility, the scholar_flux.api.ReconstructedResponse class is used for as an adapter throughout the
request retrieval, response processing, and caching processes to ensure that the ResponseProtocol generalizes to
other implementations when not directly using the default `requests` client.
