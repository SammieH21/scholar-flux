# /utils/paths
"""

The scholar_flux.utils.paths module contains a series of related classes that serve the purpose of providing a unified
interface for processing json paths in a manner that simplifies the implementation of nested values into paths
leading to terminal values (keys) and the terminal elements (values).

Modules:
    - processing_paths.py: Implements the ProcessingPath class which provides the basic building block for defining the
                           nested path location where terminal values are stored in structured json data consisting of
                           dictionaries, lists, and other nested elements.
    - path_nodes.py:       Implements a PathNode class where processing_paths are paired with a `value` at its `path`
    - path_discoverer.py:  Defines the PathDiscoverer that recursively finds terminal paths up to a specific max depth.
                           This implementation is designed to create a dictionary by processing a json data structure to
                           create a new flattened dictionary consisting of terminal ProcessingPaths (keys) and their
                           associated data at these terminal paths (values).
    - path_node_map:       Defines validated PathNodeMap data structure built off a user dict to efficiently store
                           nodes found at terminal paths. This mapping also uses a generated a cache that uses `weakref`
                           to keep a running mapping of all terminal nodes.
    - path_chain_map       Implements the PathRecordMap that adds a mandatory record index to PathNodeMaps for consistency
                           when reading and manipulating JSON data nested within lists. The PathChainMap is also implemented,
                           building on the PathChainMap for increased consistency and faster retrieval of nodes associated with
                           particular records in a JSON data set. Operates as a drop-in replacement when used in a PathNodeIndex.
    - path_index:          Implements a PathNodeIndex data structure used to orchestrate the processing path-based
                           sparse trie data structures that take a JSON  and extract, flatten, and simplify the original
                           data structure to create an easy to process flattened dictionary.
    - path_simplifier      Implements the PathSimplifier utility class that takes a PathNodeIndex as input, identifies
                           unique paths (ignoring index) and simplifying the path into a flattened list that outputs
                           joined paths collapsed into string or flattened into a list.

    >>>                 "assistant": "Jane Doe"
    >>>             },
    >>>             "doi": "10.1234/example.doi",

    >>>             }
    >>>         }
    >>>     ]
    ### Create a new index to process the current json
    >>> path_node_index = PathNodeIndex()
    # orchestrate the pipeline of identifying terminal paths and nodes, followed by frmatting and flattening
    # the paths used to arrive at each value at the end of the terminal path.
    >>> normalized_records = path_node_index.normalize_records(record_test_json, object_delimiter = None)
    >>> print(normalized_records)
