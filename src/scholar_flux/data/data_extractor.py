class DataExtractor(BaseDataExtractor):
    """The DataExtractor allows for the streamlined extraction of records and metadata from responses retrieved from
    APIs. This proceeds as the second stage of the response processing step where metadata and records are extracted
    from parsed responses.

    The data extractor provides two ways to identify metadata paths and record paths:

        1) manual identification: If record path or metadata_path are specified,
           then the data extractor will attempt to retrieve the metadata and records at the
           provided paths. Note that, as metadata_paths can be associated with multiple keys,
           starting from the outside dictionary, we may have to specify a dictionary containing
           keys denoting metadata variables and their paths as a list of values indicating how to
           retrieve the value. The path can also be given by a list of lists describing how to
           retrieve the last element.
        2) Dynamic identification: Uses heuristics to determine records from metadata. records
           will nearly always be defined by a list containing only dictionaries as its elements
           while the metadata will generally contain a variety of elements, some nested and others
           as integers, strings, etc. In some cases where its harder to determine, we can use
           dynamic_record_identifiers to determine whether a list containing a single nested dictionary
           is a record or metadata. For scientific purposes, its keys may contain 'abstract', 'title', 'doi',
           etc. This can be defined manually by the users if the defaults are not reliable for a given API.

    Upon initializing the class, the class can be used as a callable that returns the records and metadata
    in that order.

    Example:
        >>> from scholar_flux.data import DataExtractor
        >>> data = dict(query='specification driven development', options={'record_count':5,'response_time':'50ms'})
        >>> data['records'] = [dict(id=1, record='protocol vs.code'), dict(id=2, record='Impact of Agile')]
        >>> extractor = DataExtractor()
        >>> records, metadata = extractor(data)
        >>> print(metadata)
        # OUTPUT: {'query': 'specification driven development', 'record_count': 5, 'response_time': '50ms'}
        >>> print(records)
        # OUTPUT: [{'id': 1, 'record': 'protocol vs.code'}, {'id': 2, 'record': 'Impact of Agile'}]
