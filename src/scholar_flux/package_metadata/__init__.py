"""

The scholar_flux.package_metadata module is a helper module that holds information relevant to
the initialization and storage of data related to the scholar_flux package.

At the moment, the package_metadata module has two responsibilities:
    1. Retrieving the current version number of the scholar_flux package from the importlib module
    2. Indicating the first available writeable directory dedicated to scholar_flux cache.
       for directory cache, the following directories are prioritized in the following order.
       Prioritization is given to:
         1. The scholar_flux/package_directory for cache and scholar_flux/logs for logging
       And otherwise:
         2. The ~/.scholar_flux/package_cache directory for cache and ~/.scholar_flux/logs for logging
      The first writeable directory will then be used for setting up default locations for requests and response cache.
