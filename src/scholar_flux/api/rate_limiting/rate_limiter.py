class RateLimiter:
    """A basic rate limiter used to ensure that function calls (such as API requests) do not exceed a specified rate.

    The `RateLimiter` is used within ScholarFlux to throttle the total number of requests that can be made within a
    defined time interval (measured in seconds).

    This class ensures that calls to `RateLimiter.wait()` (or any decorated function) are spaced
    by at least `min_interval` seconds.

    For multithreading applications, the `RateLimiter` is not thread-safe. Instead, the `ThreadedRateLimiter` subclass
    can provide a thread-safe implementation when required.

    Args:
        min_interval (Optional[float | int]):
            The minimum number of seconds that must elapse before another request sent or call is performed. If
            `min_interval` is not specified, then class attribute, `RateLimiter.DEFAULT_MIN_INTERVAL` will be assigned
            to `RateLimiter.min_interval` instead.

    Examples:
        >>> import requests
        >>> from scholar_flux.api import RateLimiter
        >>> rate_limiter = RateLimiter(min_interval = 5)
        >>> # The first call won't sleep, because a prior call using the rate limiter doesn't yet exist
        >>> with rate_limiter:
        ...     response = requests.get("http://httpbin.org/get")
        >>> # will sleep if 5 seconds since the last call hasn't elapsed.
        >>> with rate_limiter:
        ...     response = requests.get("http://httpbin.org/get")
        >>> # Or simply call the `wait` method directly:
        >>> rate_limiter.wait()
