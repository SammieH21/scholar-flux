class APIResponse(BaseModel):
    """
    A Response wrapper for responses of different types that allows consistency when using several possible backends.
    The purpose of this class is to serve as the base for managing responses received from scholarly APIs while
    processing each component in a predictable, reproducible manner,


    This class uses pydantic's data validation and serialization/deserialization methods to aid caching and includes
    properties that refer back to the original response for displaying valid response codes, URLs, etc.

    All future processing/error based responses classes inherit from and build off of this class.

    Args:
        cache_key (Optional[str]): A string for recording cache keys for use in later steps of the response
                                   orchestration involving processing, cache storage, and cache retrieval
        response (Any): A response or response-like object to be validated and used/re-used in later caching
                        and response processing/orchestration steps.
        created_at (Optional[str]): A value indicating the time in which a response or response-like object was created.

    Example:
        >>> from scholar_flux.api import APIResponse
        # Using keyword arguments to build a basic APIResponse data container:
        >>> response = APIResponse.from_response(
        >>>     cache_key = 'test-response',
        >>>     status_code = 200,
        >>>     content=b'success',
        >>>     url='https://example.com',
        >>>     headers={'Content-Type': 'application/text'}
        >>> )
        >>> response
        # OUTPUT: APIResponse(cache_key='test-response', response = ReconstructedResponse(
