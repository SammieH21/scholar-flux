# /api/models/search_results.py
"""
The scholar_flux.api.models.search_results module defines the SearchResult and SearchResultList
implementations that aid in the retrieval of multi-page and multi-coordinated searches.

These implementations allow increased organization for the API output of multiple searches
by defining the provider, page, query, and response result retrieved from multi-page searches
from the SearchCoordinator and multi-provider/page searches using the MultiSearchCoordinator.

Classes:
    SearchResult: Pydantic Base class that stores the search result as well as the query, provider name, and page.
    SearchResultList: Inherits from a basic list to constrain the output to a list of SearchResults while providing
                      data preparation convenience functions for downstream frameworks.
