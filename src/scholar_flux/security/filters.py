"""
The scholar_flux.security.filters module implements the basic foundational filter used by logging utilities
to determine how text will be masked and redacted prior to being stored in file handlers or written to the
console.

This module uses the `SensitiveDataMasker` class to flag and redact text prior to it ever reaching the console
or file via the `logging` module.

class MaskingFilter(logging.Filter):
    """
    Custom class for adding a masking to the logs: Uses the SensitiveDataMasker in order to enforce
    the rules detailing which fields should be logged. By default, the SensitiveDataMasker masks API
    keys and email parameters in requests to APIs sent via scholar_flux.

    Initialized MaskingFilters can also be updated without re-instantiation by adding or removing patterns
    from the set of all patterns within the received Masker.

    This class can otherwise be added to other loggers with minimal effort:
        >>> import logging
        >>> from scholar_flux.security import MaskingFilter # contains the filter
        >>> formatting = "%(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s" # custom format
        >>> logger = logging.getLogger('security_logger') # gets or creates a new logger
        >>> logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG, format=formatting) # set the level and formatting for the log
        >>> logging_filter = MaskingFilter() # creating a new filter
        >>> logger.addFilter(logging_filter) # adding the filter and formatting rules
        >>> logger.info("The following api key should be filtered: API_KEY='an_api_key_that_needs_to_be_filtered'")
