There is a lack of high-quality evidence on infant mortality measured through different dimensions of social inequality in Angola. Thus, this paper was carried out to address the knowledge gap by conducting in-depth examination of infant mortality rate (IMR) inequality among population subgroups to provide more nuanced evidence to help end IMR disparity in the country. Methods: The World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) Health Equity Assessment Toolkit (HEAT) was used to analyze IMR inequality. HEAT is a software application that facilitates examination of disparities in reproductive, maternal, neonatal and child health indicators using the WHO Health Equity Monitor (HEM) database. Inequality of IMR was analyzed through disaggregation by five equity stratifiers: education, wealth, gender, subnational region and residence. These were analyzed through three inequality measures: Population Attributable Risk, Ratio and Slope Index of Inequality. A 95% confidence Interval (CI) was built around point estimates to determine statistical significance. Results: A notable disadvantage was found for children born to poor (Population Attributable Risk (PAR): -27.0; -28.4, -26.0) and uneducated (PAR: -17.0; -17.9, -16.0), women who live in rural areas (PAR: -7.3;-7.8, -6.7) and those residing in certain regions of the country (PAR: -43.0; 45.3, -4). Male infants had a higher risk of death than female infants (PAR: -6.8;-7.5, -6.2). The subnational regional variation of IMR had been the most evident when compared with the disparities in the other equity stratifers. Conclusions: Policymakers and planners need to address the disproportionately higher clustering of IMR among infants born to disadvantaged subpopulations through interventions that benefit such subgroups.

As countries enter the post-MDG era and strive toward UHC, it will be important to monitor the extent to which countries are achieving equity of RH and MH service coverage. This study explores how equity of service coverage differs across countries, and explores what policy factors are associated with a country\u2019s progress, or lack thereof, toward more equitable RH and MH service coverage. Methods: We used RH and MH service coverage data from Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) for 74 countries to examine trends in equity between countries and over time from 1990 to 2014. We examined trends in both relative and absolute equity, and measured relative equity using a concentration index of coverage data grouped by wealth quintile. Through multivariate analysis we examined the relative importance of policy factors, such as political commitment to health, governance, and the level of prepayment, in determining countries\u2019 progress toward greater equity in RH and MH service coverage. Results: Relative equity for the coverage of RH and MH services has continually increased across all countries over the past quarter century; however, inequities in coverage persist, in some countries more than others. Multivariate analysis shows that higher education and greater political commitment (measured as the share of government spending allocated to health) were significantly associated with higher equity of service coverage. Neither country income, i.e., GDP per capita, nor better governance were significantly associated with equity. Conclusion: Equity in RH and MH service coverage has improved but varies considerably across countries and over time. Even among the subset of countries that are close to achieving the MDGs, progress made on equity varies considerably across countries. Enduring disparities in access and outcomes underpin mounting support for targeted reforms within the broader context of universal health coverage (UHC).

Measuring the process of realizing common wealth and the differences between groups is one of the important issues that need to be addressed urgently. In order to reasonably measure the process of realizing common wealth in China, on the premise of horizontal comparability and vertical consistency, the principles of comparability and consistency are introduced, and a comparative method of opportunity advantage based on income distribution is proposed from the perspective of opportunity equity. Using the 2012\u20132020 CFPS data to measure and test the opportunity advantages and their differences across regions and groups in China. The study found, firstly, that the opportunity advantage persists but tends to diminish across groups, with the more educated group having a more pronounced opportunity advantage, but that this advantage is diminishing over time. Secondly, the doctoral degree group has a greater probability of earning higher incomes, followed by the master\u2019s and bachelor\u2019s degree groups, but this opportunity advantage, i.e., the probability of earning higher incomes, is diminishing, i.e., the education dividend is diminishing. Third, the difference in opportunity advantage between urban and rural areas still exists, as evidenced by the greater probability of higher incomes in towns than in rural areas, but this advantage has narrowed further over time, with a clear process of urban-rural integration. Fourthly, in terms of gender, men have a certain opportunity advantage over women, but this difference is not significant. Fifthly, in the context of education levels, gender and urban/rural subgroups, under the framework proposed in this paper, China has achieved some success in the process of realizing the common wealth, and is showing a steady upward trend.\n"], "title_display": "Analyzing the process of achieving common wealth for different groups in China based on the opportunity advantage perspective of income distribution", "score": 16.606562}, {"id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0127827", "journal": "PLOS ONE", "eissn": "1932-6203", "publication_date": "2015-05-22T00:00:00Z", "article_type": "Research Article", "author_display": ["Calistus Wilunda", "Giovanni Putoto", "Donata Dalla Riva", "Fabio Manenti", "Andrea Atzori", "Federico Calia", "Tigist Assefa", "Bruno Turri", "Onapa Emmanuel", "Manuela Straneo", "Firma Kisika", "Giorgio Tarmbulini"], "abstract": ["Background: Gaps in coverage, equity and quality of health services hinder the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals 4 and 5 in most countries of sub-Saharan Africa as well as in other high-burden countries, yet few studies attempt to assess all these dimensions as part of the situation analysis. We present the base-line data of a project aimed at simultaneously addressing coverage, equity and quality issues in maternal and neonatal health care in five districts belonging to three African countries. Methods: Data were collected in cross-sectional studies with three types of tools. Coverage was assessed in three hospitals and 19 health centres (HCs) utilising emergency obstetric and newborn care needs assessment tools developed by the Averting Maternal Death and Disability program. Emergency obstetrics care (EmOC) indicators were calculated. Equity was assessed in three hospitals and 13 HCs by means of proxy wealth indices and women delivering in health facilities were compared with those in the general population to identify inequities. Quality was assessed in three hospitals using the World Health Organization\u2019s maternal and neonatal quality of hospital care assessment tool which evaluates the whole range of aspects of obstetric and neonatal care and produces an average score for each main area of care. Results: All the three hospitals qualified as comprehensive EmOC facilities but none of the HCs qualified for basic EmOC. None of the districts met the minimum requisites for EmOC indicators. In two out of three hospitals, there were major quality gaps which were generally greater in neonatal care, management of emergency and complicated cases and monitoring. Higher access to care was coupled by low quality and good quality by very low access. Stark inequities in utilisation of institutional delivery care were present in all districts and across all health facilities, especially at hospital level. Conclusion: Our findings confirm the existence of serious issues regarding coverage, equity and quality of health care for mothers and newborns in all study districts. Gaps in one dimension hinder the potential gains in health outcomes deriving from good performances in other dimensions, thus confirm the need for a three-dimensional profiling of health care provision as a basis for data-driven planning.

In this review, we provide a practical guide to measuring and interpreting inequalities based on surveys carried out in low- and middle-income countries, with a focus on the health of mothers and children. Relevant stratification variables include urban/rural residence, geographic region, and educational level, but breakdowns by wealth status are increasingly popular. For the latter, a classification based on an asset index is the most appropriate for national surveys. The measurement of intervention coverage can be made by single indicators, but the use of combined measures has important advantages, and we advocate two summary measures (the composite coverage index and the co-coverage indicator) for the study of time trends and for cross-country comparisons. We highlight the need for inequality measures that take the whole socioeconomic distribution into account, such as the relative concentration index and the slope index of inequality, although simpler measures such as the ratio and difference between the richest and poorest groups may also be presented for non-technical audiences. Finally, we present a framework for the analysis of time trends in inequalities, arguing that it is essential to study both absolute and relative indicators, and we provide guidance to the joint interpretation of these results.\n"], "title_display": "Measuring Coverage in MNCH: Determining and Interpreting Inequalities in Coverage of Maternal, Newborn, and Child Health Interventions", "score": 16.46662}, {"id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0293522", "journal": "PLOS ONE", "eissn": "1932-6203", "publication_date": "2023-12-20T00:00:00Z", "article_type": "Research Article", "author_display": ["Frehiwot Birhanu", "Kiddus Yitbarek"], "abstract": ["Objectives: Every child around the globe should get routine childhood vaccination, which is mostly affected by the country\u2019s economic capacity besides the socioeconomic differences.

Our model could be useful for policy evaluation and future studies concerning older adults. Our first contribution to the previous literature is modeling the whole adult life-cycle. This enables us to determine whether decisions in youth and middle age are influenced by anticipated health shocks in old age. Our second contribution is modeling housing explicitly with health shocks. Conclusions regarding the savings puzzle may be significantly influenced by the explicit modeling of housing. We develop a more realistic model by relaxing some of the assumptions made in previous studies. We find that health shocks motivate the household to accumulate higher wealth before retirement. Moreover, as health shocks become more severe, individuals reduce their consumption and decumulate less wealth in old age. Health shocks help explain the flat trends observed in the housing and wealth profiles of older adults.

We estimated the inequities in childhood immunisation coverage associated with socioeconomic, geographic, maternal, child, and healthcare characteristics among children aged 12\u201323 months in Nigeria using a social determinants of health perspective. Methods: We conducted a systematic review to identify the social determinants of childhood immunisation associated with inequities in vaccination coverage among low- and middle-income countries. Using the 2018 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), we conducted multiple logistic regression to estimate the association between basic childhood vaccination coverage (1-dose BCG, 3-dose DTP-HepB-Hib (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B and Haemophilus influenzae type B), 3-dose polio, and 1-dose measles) and socioeconomic, geographic, maternal, child, and healthcare characteristics in Nigeria. Results: From the systematic review, we identified the key determinants of immunisation to be household wealth, religion, and ethnicity for socioeconomic characteristics; region and place of residence for geographic characteristics; maternal age at birth, maternal education, and household head status for maternal characteristics; sex of child and birth order for child characteristics; and antenatal care and birth setting for healthcare characteristics. Based of the 2018 Nigeria DHS analysis of 6,059 children aged 12\u201323 months, we estimated that basic vaccination coverage was 31% (95% CI: 29\u201333) among children aged 12\u201323 months, whilst 19% (95% CI:18\u201321) of them were zero-dose children who had received none of the basic vaccines. After controlling for background characteristics, there was a significant increase in the odds of basic vaccination by household wealth (AOR: 3.21 (2.06, 5.00), p < 0.001) for the wealthiest quintile compared to the poorest quintile, antenatal care of four or more antenatal care visits compared to no antenatal care (AOR: 2.87 (2.21, 3.72), p < 0.001), delivery in a health facility compared to home births (AOR 1.32 (1.08, 1.61), p = 0.006), relatively older maternal age of 35\u201349 years compared to 15\u201319 years (AOR: 2.25 (1.46, 3.49), p < 0.001), and maternal education of secondary or higher education compared to no formal education (AOR: 1.79 (1.39, 2.31), p < 0.001). Children of Fulani ethnicity in comparison to children of Igbo ethnicity had lower odds of receiving basic vaccinations (AOR: 0.51 (0.26, 0.97), p = 0.039). Conclusions: Basic vaccination coverage is below target levels for all groups. Children from the poorest households, of Fulani ethnicity, who were born in home settings, and with young mothers with no formal education nor antenatal care, were associated with lower odds of basic vaccination in Nigeria.

These improvements may, however, mask considerable disparities between subnational populations. In this paper, we examine the extent of the country's child mortality inequalities. Methods: Mortality rates for children under-five and neonates were directly estimated using the 2000, 2005 and 2010 waves of the Cambodian Demographic Health Survey. Disparities were measured on both absolute and relative scales using rate differences and ratios, and where applicable, slope and relative indices of inequality by levels of rural/urban location, regions and household wealth. Findings: Since 2000, considerable reductions in under-five and to a lesser extent in neonatal mortality rates have been observed. This mortality decline has, however, been accompanied by an increase in relative inequality in both rates of child mortality for geography-related stratifying markers. For absolute inequality amongst regions, most trends are increasing, particularly for neonatal mortality, but are not statistically significant. The only exception to this general pattern is the statistically significant positive trend in absolute inequality for under-five mortality in the Coastal region. For wealth, some evidence for increases in both relative and absolute inequality for neonates is observed. Conclusion: Despite considerable gains in reducing under-five and neonatal mortality at a national level, entrenched and increased geographical and wealth-based inequality in mortality, at least on a relative scale, remain. As expected, national progress seems to be associated with the period of political and macroeconomic stability that started in the early 2000s.

Absolute and relative inequalities were measured by rate differences and ratios, and where possible, slope and relative indices of inequality. Disparities were assessed by levels of rural/urban location, island groups, maternal education and household wealth. Findings: Declines in national rates of under-five and neonatal mortality have accorded with reductions of absolute inequalities in clusters stratified by wealth, maternal education and rural/urban location. Across these groups, relative inequalities have generally stabilised, with possible increases with respect to mortality across wealth subpopulations. Both relative and absolute inequalities in rates of under-five and neonatal mortality stratified by island divisions have widened. Conclusion: Indonesia has made considerable gains in reducing under-five and neonatal mortality at a national level, with the largest reductions happening before the Asian financial crisis (1997\u201398) and decentralisation (2000).

A successful approach to global inequality monitoring must be intuitive enough for widespread adoption, yet maintain technical credibility. This article discusses methodological considerations for equity-oriented monitoring of UHC, and proposes recommendations for monitoring and target setting. Inequality is multidimensional, such that the extent of inequality may vary considerably across different dimensions such as economic status, education, sex, and urban/rural residence. Hence, global monitoring should include complementary dimensions of inequality (such as economic status and urban/rural residence) as well as sex. For a given dimension of inequality, subgroups for monitoring must be formulated taking into consideration applicability of the criteria across countries and subgroup heterogeneity. For economic-related inequality, we recommend forming subgroups as quintiles, and for urban/rural inequality we recommend a binary categorization. Inequality spans populations, thus appropriate approaches to monitoring should be based on comparisons between two subgroups (gap approach) or across multiple subgroups (whole spectrum approach). When measuring inequality absolute and relative measures should be reported together, along with disaggregated data; inequality should be reported alongside the national average. We recommend targets based on proportional reductions in absolute inequality across populations. Building capacity for health inequality monitoring is timely, relevant, and important. The development of high-quality health information systems, including data collection, analysis, interpretation, and reporting practices that are linked to review and evaluation cycles across health systems, will enable effective global and national health inequality monitoring. These actions will support equity-oriented progressive realization of UHC.\n"], "title_display": "Equity-Oriented Monitoring in the Context of Universal Health Coverage", "score": 16.177597}, {"id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0234483", "journal": "PLOS ONE", "eissn": "1932-6203", "publication_date": "2020-06-10T00:00:00Z", "article_type": "Research Article", "author_display": ["Gebretsadik Shibre", "Dina Idriss-Wheeler", "Sanni Yaya"], "abstract": ["Background: Substantial inequality in neonatal mortality rates (NMR) remains in low- and middle-income countries to the detriment of disadvantaged subpopulations. In Ethiopia, there is a dearth of evidence on the extent and trends of disparity in NMR. This study assessed the socioeconomic, residence and sex-based inequalities in NMR, as well as examined its change over a sixteen year period in Ethiopia. Methods: Using the World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) Health Equity Assessment Toolkit (HEAT) software, data from the Ethiopia Demographic and Health Surveys (EDHS) were analyzed between 2000 and 2016. NMR was disaggregated by four equity stratifiers: education, wealth, residence and sex. In addition, absolute and relative inequality measures, namely Difference, Population Attributable Risk (PAR), Ratio, Relative Concentration Index (RCI) and Slope Index of Inequality (SII) were calculated to understand inequalities from different perspectives. Corresponding 95% Uncertainty Intervals (UIs) were computed to measure statistical significance. Findings: Large educational inequalities in NMR were found in 2000, 2005, and 2011, while wealth-driven inequality occurred in 2011. Sex disparity was noted in all the surveys, and urban-rural differentials remained in all the surveys except in 2016. While socioeconomic and area-related inequalities decreased over time, sex related inequality did not change during the period of study. Conclusions: NMR appeared to be concentrated among male newborns, neonates born to illiterate and poor women and those living in rural settings. However, the inequality narrowed over time.

Methods: Data from the 2011 Mozambican Demographic and Health Survey on women who are married or living together are analyzed for the entire country and also for the rural and urban areas separately. We used single level and multilevel probit regression models. Findings: A single level probit regression reveals that region, religion, age, previous fertility, education, and wealth impact contraceptive behavior. The multilevel analysis shows that average community wealth and the women\u2019s relative socioeconomic position within the community have significant positive effects on the use of modern contraceptives. The multilevel framework proved to be necessary in rural settings but not relevant in urban areas. Moreover, the contextual effects due to community wealth are greater in rural than in urban areas and this feature is associated with the higher socioeconomic heterogeneity within the richest communities. Conclusion: This analysis highlights the need for the studies on contraceptive behavior to specifically address the individual and contextual effects arising from the poverty-wealth dimension in rural and urban areas separately. The inclusion in a particular community of residence is not relevant in urban areas, but it is an important feature in rural areas. Although the women's individual position within the community of residence has a similar effect on contraceptive adoption in rural and urban settings, the impact of community wealth is greater in rural areas and smaller in urban areas.

Methods: Institutional review board approval for this study was granted from Public Health Service\u2014Ethical Review Board (PHS-ERB) and from the Health Ministry Screening Committee (HMSC) facilitated by Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR). IRB review and approval for the current analyses was obtained from University of California, San Diego. Cross-sectional data were collected from women with children aged 0\u201311 months (n = 5,565) from rural households in 25 districts of Uttar Pradesh, India. Participants were surveyed on maternal healthcare utilization including registration of pregnancy (model-1), receipt of antenatal care (ANC) during pregnancy (model-2), and delivery at health facilities (model -3). Social determinants of health including wealth, social group, literacy, religion, and early age at marriage were captured during the survey. The Classification and Regression Tree (CART) algorithm was used to explore intersections of social determinants of healthcare utilization. Results: CART analyses highlight the intersections, particularly of wealth and literacy, in maternal healthcare utilization in Uttar Pradesh. Model-1 documents that women who are poorer, illiterate and Muslim are less likely to have their pregnancies registered (71.4% vs. 86.0% in the overall sample). Model-2 documents that poorer, illiterate women had the lowest ANC coverage (37.7% vs 45% in the overall sample). Model-3, developed for deliveries at health facilities, highlighted that illiterate and poor women have the lowest representation among facility deliveries (59.6% vs. 69% in the overall sample). Conclusion: This paper explores the interactions between determinants of maternal healthcare utilization indicators. The findings in this paper highlights that the interaction of wealth and literacy can play a very strong role in accentuating or diminishing healthcare utilization among women. The study also reveals that religion and women\u2019s age at marriage also interact with wealth and literacy to create substantial disparities in utilization.

Methods: Data for 20,468 women who gave birth in the five years preceding 2013 Nigerian Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) were used for this study. Inequality in caesarean delivery was assessed using the concentration curve and multiple logistic regression models. Results: There was a high concentration in the utilisation of caesarean section among the women in the relatively high wealth quintile. Overall, delivery by caesarean section was 2.1%, but the rate was highest among women who had higher education and belonged to the richest wealth quintile (13.6%) and lowest among women without formal education and who belonged to the poorest wealth quintile (0.4%). Belonging to the poorest wealth quintile and having no formal education were associated with lower odds of having delivery by caesarean section. Conclusion: In conclusion, women in the richest households are within the WHO\u2019s recommended level of 10\u201315% for caesarean birth utilisation, but women in the poorest households are so far away from the recommended rate.

This study aims to describe and assess the level and the distribution of health outcomes and coverage for key services in Ethiopia, and their association with socioeconomic and geographic determinants. Methods: Data were obtained from the 2000, 2005 and 2011 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Surveys. As indicators of access to health care, the following variables were included: Under-five and neonatal deaths, skilled birth attendance, coverage of vaccinations, oral rehydration therapy for diarrhoea, and antibiotics for suspected pneumonia. For each of the indicators in 2011, inequality was described by estimating their concentration index and a geographic Gini index. For further assessment of the inequalities, the concentration indices were decomposed. An index of health achievement, integrating mean coverage and the distribution of coverage, was estimated. Changes from 2000 to 2011 in coverage, inequality and health achievement were assessed. Results: Significant pro-rich inequalities were found for all indicators except treatment for suspected pneumonia in 2011. The geographic Gini index showed significant regional inequality for most indicators. The decomposition of the 2011 concentration indices revealed that the factor contributing the most to the observed inequalities was different levels of wealth. The mean of all indicators improved from 2000 to 2011, and the health achievement index improved for most indicators. The socioeconomic inequalities seem to increase from 2000 to 2011 for under-five and neonatal deaths, whereas they are stable or decreasing for the other indicators. Conclusion: There is an unequal socioeconomic and geographic distribution of health and access to key services in Ethiopia. Although the health achievement indices improved for most indicators from 2000 to 2011, socioeconomic determinants need to be addressed in order to achieve better and more fairly distributed health.

Aims: Examine the gender difference in HCE in short-term and major morbidity in India, and understand the role of factors underlying the difference. Data and Methods: Using two rounds of nationally representative panel data\u2014the India Human Development Survey (IHDS) 2004\u20132005 and 2011\u20132012 (IHDS I & II)\u2014we calculate morbidity prevalence rate and mean HCE by gender, and examine the adjusted effect of gender on major morbidity-related HCE by using a two-part regression model. Further, we performed Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition of the gender gap in HCE in major morbidity to understand the contribution of demographic and socio-economic factors. Results: Health-care expenditure on females was systematically lower than on males across all demographic and socio-economic groups. Multivariate analysis confirms that female HCE is significantly lower than male HCE even after controlling demographic and socio-economic factors (\u03b2 = -0.148, p = 0.000, CI:-0.206\u20130.091). For both short-term and major morbidity, a female disadvantage on HCE increased from IHDS I to IHDS II. For instance, the male\u2013female gap in major morbidity related expenditure increased from INR 1298 to INR 4172. A decomposition analysis of gender gap in HCE demonstrates that about 48% of the gap is attributable to differences in demographic and socio-economic factors (endowment effect), whereas 50% of the gap is due to the differential effect of the determinants (coefficient effect). Interpretation: Indians spend less on female health care than on male health care. Most of the gender gap in HCE is not due to differential distribution of factors affecting HCE.

A scientific and reasonable share repurchase policy has a significant financial effect in terms of an equity structure optimization, capital structure adjustment, cash holding control, and even management compensation system design. The long-standing share repurchase in the U.K. and U.S. companies and the recent practice of share repurchase by Chinese listed companies imply an important financial proposition: share repurchase is a high-quality financial policy that, when properly applied, will help reduce the cost of capital.

This study also finds that Chinese listed companies, when formulating and implementing share repurchase programs, do not subjectively view share repurchases as a policy tool to adjust cash holdings and capital structure. In addition, they do not view share repurchases as an alternative to cash dividends but use equity incentives for management as the main intention for share repurchases. This decision-making concept is not conducive to the rational use of share repurchase policies in the long run and should be a cause for concern in the business community. Finally, the leverage and the cash holding path are the main motives affecting share repurchases and are the important fundamental mechanisms in this study, while the mediating mechanism test finds that share repurchases mainly reduce the cost of capital through two information perspectives of analyst following and stock liquidity.

Five equity dimensions were used to disaggregate datasets on healthcare seeking behavior for diarrhea, fever, and ARI symptoms: Based on wealth status, education, place of residence, sex of the child and administrative regions. Second, summary measures such as: equity gaps, equity ratios, population attributable fraction (PAF), population attributable Risk (PAR), absolute concentration index (ACI) and relative concentration index (RCI), was used. The concentration curve and horizontal inequity indices were used to evaluate the wealth-related disparities. To measure the determinants a multilevel logistic regression with 95% confidence interval was employed. \nResult\n: This study showed remarkable improvement in healthcare seeking behavior for symptoms of diarrhea, fever and ARI among under-five children between 2000 and 2016. The increases are more, from the poorest subgroups compared to the wealthiest. The absolute percentage point changes (or healthcare seeking rate changes) between 2000 and 2016 among the poorest quintile of households are at least twice that of the wealthiest quintile for symptoms of diarrhea. However, significant disparities between the rich and the poor persist for the majority of the indicators examined for the three childhood morbidities. Moreover, horizontal inequity indices and the concentration curve both point out to the existence of pro-rich inequity in healthcare seeking behavior for under five children.

The objective of this paper is to examine the relationship between women's economic, educational and empowerment status, introduced as the 3Es, and maternal health service utilization in developing countries. Methods/Principal Findings: The analysis uses data from the most recent Demographic and Health Surveys conducted in 31 countries for which data on all the 3Es are available.

We use meta-analysis techniques to combine and summarize results from multiple countries. The 3Es are significantly associated with utilization of maternal health services. The odds of having a skilled attendant at delivery for women in the poorest wealth quintile are 94% lower than that for women in the highest wealth quintile and almost 5 times higher for women with complete primary education relative to those less educated. The likelihood of using modern contraception and attending four or more antenatal care visits are 2.01 and 2.89 times, respectively, higher for women with complete primary education than for those less educated. Women with the highest empowerment score are between 1.31 and 1.82 times more likely than those with a null empowerment score to use modern contraception, attend four or more antenatal care visits and have a skilled attendant at birth.

Clinical social franchising, which applies the commercial franchising model to achieve social goals and improve health care, is increasingly used in developing countries to respond to these limitations. Despite the growth of this approach, limited evidence documents the effect of social franchising on improving health care quality and access. Objectives and Methods: We examined peer-reviewed and grey literature to evaluate the effect of social franchising on health care quality, equity, cost-effectiveness, and health outcomes. We included all studies of clinical social franchise programs located in low- and middle-income countries. We assessed study bias using the WHO-Johns Hopkins Rigour Scale and used narrative synthesis to evaluate the findings. Results: Of 113 identified articles, 23 were included in this review; these evaluated a small sample of franchises globally and focused on reproductive health franchises. Results varied widely across outcomes and programs. Social franchising was positively associated with increased client volume and client satisfaction. The findings on health care utilization and health impact were mixed; some studies find that franchises significantly outperform other models of health care, while others show franchises are equivalent to or worse than other private or public clinics. In two areas, cost-effectiveness and equity, social franchises were generally found to have poorer outcomes. Conclusions: Our review indicates that social franchising may strengthen some elements of private sector health care. However, gaps in the evidence remain.

Conclusions/Significance: Recent efforts to scale up malaria intervention coverage have achieved equity in some countries (especially with ITNs), but delivery methods in other countries are not addressing the most at-risk populations. As countries seek universal malaria intervention coverage, their delivery systems must reach the rural and poor populations; this is not a small task, but it has been achieved in some countries.

We previously developed the EconomicClusters k-medoids clustering-based algorithm for defining population-specific economic models based on few Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) assets. The algorithm previously defined a twenty-group economic model for Cameroon. The aims of this study are to optimize the functionality of our EconomicClusters algorithm and app based on collaborator feedback from early use of this twenty-group economic model, to test the validity of the model as a metric of economic status, and to assess the utility of the model in another LMIC context. We condense the twenty Cameroonian economic groups into fewer, ordinally-ranked, groups using agglomerative hierarchical clustering based on mean cluster child height-for-age Z-score (HAZ), women\u2019s literacy score, and proportion of children who are deceased. We develop an EconomicClusters model for Ghana consisting of five economic groups and rank these groups based on the same three variables. The proportion of variance in women\u2019s literacy score accounted for by the EconomicClusters model was 5\u201312% less than the proportion of variance accounted for by the DHS Wealth Index model. The proportion of the variance in child HAZ and proportion of children who are deceased accounted for by the EconomicClusters model was similar to (0.4\u20132.5% less than) the proportion of variance accounted for by the DHS Wealth Index model.

In this study, we estimated trends in child undernutrition by social determinants and related risks from wealth inequality in Ethiopia, from 2005 to 2016. Method: We analyzed data from three consecutive surveys (2005, 2011, and 2016) from the Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey. First, we estimated trends in the prevalence of childhood undernutrition variables (stunting, underweight, and wasting) and social determinants (household wealth status, education level, place of residence, and administrative regions). Then we assessed evidence of undernutrition by wealth-related inequality with concentration curves (visual) and concentration indeces (quantitative). A multilevel mixed-effect Poisson regression model was used to identify predictors of undernutrition variables expressed as covariate-adjusted rate ratios, with 95% confidence intervals (RRs, 95%CI). Result: A total of 23,934 mother-child pairs were obtained from the three surveys. The average prevalence decreased by 12.4 percentage points for stunting (from 50.8 to 38.4%, P<0.01), 9.5 percentage points for underweight (33.2% to23.7%, P<0.01), and 2.1 percentage points for wasting (12.2% to10.1%, P<0.01). There was persistent and statistically evidence of wealth inequality in stunting, underweight, and wasting (concentration indeces of -0.2 to -0.04, all P values <0.05). Stunting, underweight, and wasting variables were associated with male sex of the child (RR 0.94, 0.95, 0.85, all P-values <0.01) recent diarrhea (RR 1.18, 1.27, 1.37, all P-values <0.01), secondary education status of the mother (RR 0.66, 0.57, 0.61, all P-values < 0.057), increasing wealth index (richest) (RR 0.73, 0.70, 0.50, all P-values < 0.05), and having no toilet facility (RR 1.16, 1.22, 1.18, all P-values < 0.05). Conclusion: Despite the decreased burden of stunting and underweight, the prevalence of wasting remained relatively unchanged in Ethiopia from 2005 to 2016. Moreover, wealth-related inequality in child undernutrition increased for most of the child undernutrition indicators during this period. Social determinants of child undernutrition warrant urgent implementation of strategies to reduce their health impacts in SSA.

CHE exists when health expenditure exceeds a certain threshold of household consumption. Although CHE is reported to have declined in Kenya, it is still unacceptably high and disproportionately affects the poor. This study examines the socioeconomic factors that contribute to inequalities in CHE as well as the change in these inequalities over time in Kenya. Methods: We used data from the Kenya household health expenditure and utilisation (KHHEUS) surveys in 2007 and 2013. The concertation index was used to measure the socioeconomic inequalities in CHE. Using the Wagstaff (2003) approach, we decomposed the concentration index of CHE to assess the relative contribution of its determinants. We applied Oaxaca-type decomposition to assess the change in CHE inequalities over time and the factors that explain it. Results: The findings show that while there was a decline in the incidence of CHE, inequalities in CHE increased from -0.271 to -0.376 and was disproportionately concentrated amongst the less well-off. Higher wealth quintiles and employed household heads positively contributed to the inequalities in CHE, suggesting that they disadvantaged the poor. The rise in CHE inequalities overtime was explained mainly by the changes in the elasticities of the household wealth status. Conclusion: Inequalities in CHE are persistent in Kenya and are largely driven by the socioeconomic status of the households. This implies that the existing financial risk protection mechanisms have not been sufficient in cushioning the most vulnerable from the financial burden of healthcare payments. Understanding the factors that sustain inequalities in CHE is, therefore, paramount in shaping pro-poor interventions that not only protect the poor from financial hardship but also reduce overall socioeconomic inequalities. This underscores the fundamental need for a multi-sectoral approach to broadly address existing socioeconomic inequalities.

Suboptimal allocations in bond holdings result in higher costs than similar misallocations in stocks. Choosing not to participate in the stock market is less detrimental than avoiding the bond market. Should retirees opt to simplify their decision-making by investing solely in one type of asset, it is less costly for them to invest exclusively in bonds. Overconsumption of housing is less costly than an equivalent underconsumption. Suboptimal consumption imposes the highest welfare cost. Decisions regarding consumption, housing, and savings are found to be more crucial than the choice of how to distribute liquid savings between stocks and bonds.

However, there is a paucity of evidence on the extent and the overtime alteration of inequality in stunting. To this end, we did this study to investigate stunting inequality and the change with time using three rounds of Mauritania Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys. The evidence is important to inform implementation of equitable nutrition interventions to help narrow inequality in stunting between population groups. Methods: World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) Health Equity Assessment Toolkit (HEAT) was used in the analysis of stunting inequality. Following standard equity analysis methods recommended by the WHO, we performed disaggregated analysis of stunting across five equity stratfiers: Wealth, education, residence, sex and sub-national regions. Then, we summarized stunting inequality through four measures of inequality: Difference, Ratio, Population Attributable Fraction and Population Attributable Risk. The point estimates of stunting were accompanied by 95% confidence intervals to measure the statistical significance of the findings. Results: The national average of childhood stunting in 2007, 2011 and 2015 was 31.3%, 29.7% and 28.2%, respectively. Glaring inequalities in stunting around the five equity stratifiers were observed in all the studied periods. In the most recent survey included in our study (2015), for instance, we recorded substantial wealth (PAF = -33.60; 95% CI: -39.79, -27.42) and education (PAF = -5.60; 95% CI: -9.68, -1.52) related stunting inequalities. Overall, no substantial improvement was documented in wealth and sex related inequality in stunting between 2007 and 2011 while region-based inequality worsened during the same time periods. Conclusions: The burden of stunting appeared to be heavily concentrated among children born to socioeconomically worse-off women, women who live in rural settings and certain subnational regions. Targeted nutrition interventions are required to address drivers of stunting embedded within geographic and socioeconomic contexts.

Socioeconomic inequities in access to long lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) are reduced with free distributions of nets. However, the relationship between social factors and retention of nets after a free distribution has been less studied, particularly using a longitudinal approach. Our research aimed to estimate the ownership and use of LLINs, and examine the determinants of LLIN retention, within an Indigenous Batwa population after a free LLIN distribution. Two LLINs were given free of charge to each Batwa household in Kanungu District, Uganda in November 2012. Surveyors collected data on LLIN ownership and use through six cross-sectional surveys pre- and post-distribution. Household retention, within household access, and individual use of LLINs were assessed over an 18-month period. Socioeconomic determinants of household retention of LLINs post-distribution were modelled longitudinally using logistic regression with random effects. Direct house-to-house distribution of free LLINs did not result in sustainable increases in the ownership and use of LLINs. Three months post-distribution, only 73% of households owned at least one LLIN and this period also saw the greatest reduction in ownership compared to other study periods. Eighteen-months post distribution, only a third of households still owned a LLIN. Self-reported age-specific use of LLINs was generally higher for children under five, declined for children aged 6\u201312, and was highest for older adults aged over 35. In the model, household wealth was a significant predictor of LLIN retention, controlling for time and other variables. This research highlights on-going socioeconomic inequities in access to malaria prevention measures among the Batwa in southwestern Uganda, even after free distribution of LLINs, and provides critical information to inform local malaria programs on possible intervention entry-points to increase access and use among this marginalized population.\n"], "title_display": "A Longitudinal Analysis of Mosquito Net Ownership and Use in an Indigenous Batwa Population after a Targeted Distribution", "score": 15.80722}, {"id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0058573", "journal": "PLoS ONE", "eissn": "1932-6203", "publication_date": "2013-03-29T00:00:00Z", "article_type": "Research Article", "author_display": ["Srinivas Goli", "Riddhi Doshi", "Arokiasamy Perianayagam"], "abstract": ["Background/Objective: Children and women comprise vulnerable populations in terms of health and are gravely affected by the impact of economic inequalities through multi-dimensional channels. Urban areas are believed to have better socioeconomic and maternal and child health indicators than rural areas. This perception leads to the implementation of health policies ignorant of intra-urban health inequalities. Therefore, the objective of this study is to explain the pathways of economic inequalities in maternal and child health indicators among the urban population of India. Methods: Using data from the third wave of the National Family Health Survey (NFHS, 2005\u201306), this study calculated relative contribution of socioeconomic factors to inequalities in key maternal and child health indicators such as antenatal check-ups (ANCs), institutional deliveries, proportion of children with complete immunization, proportion of underweight children, and Infant Mortality Rate (IMR). Along with regular CI estimates, this study applied widely used regression-based Inequality Decomposition model proposed by Wagstaff and colleagues. Results: The CI estimates show considerable economic inequalities in women with less than 3 ANCs (CI \u200a=\u200a\u22120.3501), institutional delivery (CI \u200a=\u200a\u22120.3214), children without fully immunization (CI \u200a=\u200a\u22120.18340), underweight children (CI \u200a=\u200a\u22120.19420), and infant deaths (CI \u200a=\u200a\u22120.15596). Results of the decomposition model reveal that illiteracy among women and her partner, poor economic status, and mass media exposure are the critical factors contributing to economic inequalities in maternal and child health indicators. The residuals in all the decomposition models are very less; this implies that the above mentioned factors explained maximum inequalities in maternal and child health of urban population in India.

This paper investigates the progress of UHC indicators in Ghana from 1995 to 2015 and makes future predictions up to 2030 to assess the probability of achieving UHC targets. National representative surveys of Ghana were used to assess health service coverage and financial risk protection. The analyses estimated the coverage of 13 prevention and four treatment service indicators at the national level and across wealth quintiles. In addition, we calculated catastrophic health payments and impoverishment to assess financial hardship and used a Bayesian regression model to estimate trends and future projections as well as the probabilities of achieving UHC targets by 2030. Wealth-based inequalities and regional disparities were also assessed. At the national level, 14 out of the 17 health service indicators are projected to reach the target of 80% coverage by 2030. Across wealth quintiles, inequalities were observed amongst most indicators with richer groups obtaining more coverage than their poorer counterparts. Subnational analysis revealed while all regions will achieve the 80% coverage target with high probabilities for the prevention services, the same cannot be applied to the treatment services. In 2015, the proportion of households that suffered catastrophic health payments and impoverishment at a threshold of 25% non-food expenditure were 1.9% (95%CrI: 0.9\u20133.5) and 0.4% (95%CrI: 0.2\u20130.8), respectively.

Methodology: Using data from four Demographic and Health Surveys we estimated levels and trends of neonatal, infant, and under-five mortality from 1990 to 2007. Mortality estimates at national and subnational levels were produced using both direct and indirect methods. Concentration indices were computed to measure child health inequality by wealth status. Multivariate regression analyses were used to assess the contribution of interventions and socioeconomic factors to wealth-related inequality. Findings: Despite substantial reductions in national under-five and infant mortality rates in the early 1990s, the rates of declines have slowed in recent years and neonatal mortality rates remain stubbornly high. Substantial variations across urban-rural, regional, and wealth equity-markers are evident, and suggest that the gaps between the best and worst performing sub-populations will either be maintained or widen in the future. Of the variables tested, recent wealth-related inequalities are found to be strongly associated with social factors (e.g. maternal education), regional location, and access to health services, such as facility-based delivery. Conclusion: The Philippines has achieved substantial progress towards Millennium Development Goal 4, but this success masks substantial inequalities and stagnating neonatal mortality trends. This analysis supports a focus on health interventions of high quality \u2013 that is, not just facility-based delivery, but delivery by trained staff at well-functioning facilities and supported by a strong referral system \u2013 to re-start the long term decline in neonatal mortality and to reduce persistent within-country inequalities in child health.

Blockchain architecture is ideal for ensuring security and privacy while granting individuals jurisdiction over their own information, making it a unique solution to the current limitations of existing health information systems. NFTs can be used to give patients the option to monetize their health data and provide valuable data to researchers. Wearable technology companies can also give their customers the option to monetize their data while providing data necessary to improve their products. Additionally, the process of receiving a hematopoietic stem cell transplant and the distribution of solid organs for transplantation could benefit from the integration of NFTs into the allocation process. However, there are limitations to the technology, including high energy consumption and the need for regulatory guidance.

Hence, the aim of this study is to assess levels and trends in DPT3 immunization services utilization in Ethiopia and identify inequalities. Methods: This study used data from 2000, 2005, 2011, 2016, and 2019 Ethiopian Demographic Health Surveys (EDHSs). The 2019 updated version of the world health organization (WHO\u2019s) Health Equity Assessment Toolkit (HEAT) software was used to analyze the data. Six measure of inequality was calculated: ratio (R), differences (D), relative index of inequality (RII), slope index of inequality (SII), population attributable fraction (PAF) and population attributable risk (PAR). The findings were disaggregated by the five equity stratifiers: economic status, education, place of residence, regions and sex of the child. Results: This study showed an erratic distribution of DPT3 immunization services utilization in Ethiopia. The trends in national DPT3 immunization coverage increased from 21% in (2000) to 62% in (2019) (by 41 percentage points). Regarding economic inequality, DPT3 immunization coverages for the poorest quintiles over 20 years were 15.3% (2000), and 47.7% (2019), for the richest quintiles coverage were 43.1 (2000), and 83.4% (2019). However, the service utilization among the poorest groups were increased three fold compared to the richest groups. Regarding educational status, inequality (RII) show decreasing pattern from 7.2% (2000) to 1.5% in(2019). Concerning DPT3 immunization inequality related to sex, (PAR) show that, sex related inequality is zero in 2000, 2005 and in 2019. However, based on the subnational region level, significance difference (PAR) was found in all surveys: 59.7 (2000), 51.1 (2005), 52.2 (2011), 42.5 (2016) and 30.7 (2019). The interesting point of this finding was that, the value of absolute inequality measures (PAR) and (PAF), are shown a decreasing trends from 2000 to 2019, and the gap among the better of regions and poor regions becoming narrowed over the last 20 years. Concerning individual and community level factors, household wealth index, education of the mother, age of respondent, antenatal care, and place of delivery show statically significant with outcome variable. Keeping the other variables constant the odds of an average child in Amhara Region getting DPT3 immunization was 54% less than for a child who lived in Addis Ababa (OR: 0.46, 95% CI: 0.34 \u2013 0.63). Respondents from households with the richest and richer wealth status had 1.21, and 1.26 times higher odds of DPT3 immunization services utilization compared to their counterpart (OR: 1.21, 95% CI: 1.04 -1.41) and (OR: 1.26, 95% CI: 1.13 \u2013 1.40) respectively. Conclusion: We conclude that DPT3 immunization coverage shows a growing trend over 20 years in Ethiopia. But inequalities in utilization of DPT3 immunization services among five equality stratifies studied persisted. Reasons for this could be complex and multifactorial and depending on economic, social, maternal education, place of residence, and healthcare context. Therefore, policy has to be structured and be implemented in a ways that address context specific barriers to achieving equality among population sub-groups and regions.

While there are multiple explanations for this under-use, perceptions that economic principles diverge from indigenous value systems and are rooted in Western paradigms limit the uptake of these tools to bolster resilience in the face of climate change. Nevertheless, Indigenous communities are expected to integrate their traditional systems with the historically imposed colonial systems of resource extraction to sustain their economies and community wellbeing that are challenged by environmental shifts and socioecological transitions. These changes manifest in resource use, availability and management and affect the ways Indigenous knowledge has traditionally guided resource exploitation decisions and practices. Using select examples, this paper argues that economic approaches to the management of marine resources have the potential to improve the well-being and resilience of indigenous Arctic communities. While more work is needed to tailor economic tools to the specific needs of indigenous people, the integration of resource economics and traditional approaches to resource management holds promise for strengthening Indigenous resilience in the face of the profound challenges posed by climate change.\n"], "title_display": "Harnessing economic tools for Indigenous climate resilience: Insights from Arctic marine resources", "score": 15.5959015}, {"id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0181408", "journal": "PLOS ONE", "eissn": "1932-6203", "publication_date": "2017-07-25T00:00:00Z", "article_type": "Research Article", "author_display": ["Mohammad Rifat Haider", "Mohammad Masudur Rahman", "Md.

Government of Bangladesh (GOB) with technical assistance from United Nation Population Fund (UNFPA), United Nation Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) and World Health Organization (WHO) started implementing Maternal and Neonatal Health Initiatives in selected districts of Bangladesh (MNHIB) in 2007 with an aim to reduce inequity in healthcare utilization. This study examines the effect of MNHIB on inequity in maternal care utilization. Method: Two surveys were carried out in four districts in Bangladesh- baseline in 2008 and end-line in 2013. The baseline survey collected data from 13,206 women giving birth in the preceding year and in end-line 7,177 women were interviewed. Inequity in maternal healthcare utilization was calculated pre and post-MNHIB using rich-to-poor ratio and concentration index. Results: Mean age of respondents were 23.9 and 24.6 years in 2008 and 2013 respectively. Utilization of pregnancy-related care increased for all socioeconomic strata between these two surveys. The concentration indices (CI) for various maternal health service utilization in 2013 were found to be lower than the indices in 2008. However, in comparison to contemporary BDHS data in nearby districts, MNHIB was successful in reducing inequity in receiving ANC from a trained provider (CI: 0.337 and 0.272), institutional delivery (CI: 0.435 in 2008 to 0.362 in 2013), and delivery by skilled personnel (CI: 0.396 and 0.370). Conclusions: Overall use of maternal health care services increased in post-MNHIB year compared to pre-MNHIB year and inequity in maternal service utilization declined for three indicators out of six considered in the paper. The reductions in CI values for select maternal care indicators imply that the program has been successful not only in improving utilization of maternal health services but also in lowering inequality of service utilization across socioeconomic groups. Maternal health programs, if properly designed and implemented, can improve access, partially overcoming the negative effects of socioeconomic disparities.

Yet such antecedents have been inconsistently measured in the empirical literature. This systematic review aimed to identify which measures of gender inequitable norms, views, relations and practices are currently being used in the field, and which are most closely tied with male IPV perpetration. Methods: We searched five electronic databases to identify studies published between 2000 and 2015 that reported the association between such gender inequities and male perpetration of IPV. Identified scales were categorized by content area and level of generality, as well as other attributes, and we compared the consistency of scale performance across each category. Results: Twenty-three studies were identified, employing 64 measures. Scales were categorized into three main thematic areas: views on gender roles/norms, acceptance of violence against women, and gender-related inequities in relationship power and control. We also classified whether the scale was oriented to respondents\u2019 own views, or what they believed others do or think. While overall, measures were positively associated with IPV perpetration in 45% of cases, this finding varied by scale type. Measures inclusive of acceptance of violence against women or beliefs about men\u2019s sexual entitlement, followed by scales that measured respondents\u2019 views on gender roles/norms, were most consistently associated with IPV perpetration. Measures of relationship power showed less consistent associations. We found few scales that measured peer or community norms. Conclusion: Validated scales that encompass views on the acceptance of violence against women, and scales inclusive of beliefs about men\u2019s sexual entitlement, may be particularly promising for unpacking pathways to IPV perpetration, targeting interventions, and monitoring progress in IPV prevention efforts.

This study aimed to assess socioeconomic-related inequality in health service utilization among NCD patients in China and to analyze factors associated with this disparity. Methods: Data were taken from the 2008 Chinese National Health Survey, in which a multiple stage stratified random sampling method was employed to survey 56,456 households. We analyzed the distribution of actual use, need-expected use, and need-standardized usage of outpatient services (over a two-week period) and inpatient services (over one-year) across different income groups in 27,233 adult respondents who reported as having a NCD. We used a concentration index to measure inequality in the distribution of health services, which was expressed as HI (Horizontal Inequity Index) for need-standardized use of services. A non-linear probit regression model was employed to detect inequality across socio-economic groups. Results: Pro-rich inequity in health services among NCD patients was more substantial than the average population. A higher degree of pro-rich inequity (HI\u200a=\u200a0.253) was found in inpatient services compared to outpatient services (HI\u200a=\u200a0.089). Despite a greater need for health services amongst those of lower socio-economic status, their actual use is much less than their more affluent counterparts. Health service underuse by the poor and overuse by the affluent are evident. Household income disparity was the greatest inequality factor in NCD service use for both outpatients (71.3%) and inpatients (108%), more so than health insurance policies. Some medical insurance schemes, such as the MIUE, actually made a pro-rich contribution to health service inequality (16.1% for outpatient and 12.1% for inpatient). Conclusions: Inequality in health services amongst NCD patients in China remains largely determined by patient financial capability. The current insurance schemes are insufficient to address this inequity. A comprehensive social policy that encompasses a more progressive taxation package and redistribution of social capital as well as pro-poor welfare is needed.

We performed an analysis of cross-sectional household survey data collected from a population-representative sample of 4000 adults \u226540 years in Nouna, Burkina Faso in 2018. For people with hypertension, effectiveness was assessed through care cascades describing the proportion who were screened, diagnosed, treated, and achieved hypertension control; timeliness was defined as access to care within the last three months. Patient-centredness was described using experiential quality process and outcome measures (dichotomised as higher or lower quality [score above or below and including the median, respectively]; a shared understanding and decision-making (SUDM) variable was described. Equity was assessed for effectiveness, timeliness, and patient-centredness in multivariable analyses including socio-demographic factors. In total, 1006 participants with hypertension were included.

However, there is limited research on the inequalities in advice provided by public health workers on maternal and child health during antenatal visits. This paper investigates the inequalities in advice provided by public health workers to women during antenatal visits in rural India. Methods and Findings: The District Level Household Survey (2007\u201308) was used to compute rich-poor ratios and concentration indices. Binary logistic regressions were used to investigate inequalities in advice provided by public health workers. The dependent variables comprised the advice provided on seven essential components of maternal and child health care. A significant proportion of pregnant women who attended at least four ANC sessions were not advised on these components during their antenatal sessions. Only 51%\u201372% of the pregnant women were advised on at least one of the components. Moreover, socioeconomic inequalities in providing advice were significant and the provision of advice concentrated disproportionately among the rich. Inequalities were highest in the case of advice on family planning methods. Advice on breastfeeding was least unequal. Public health workers working in lower level health facilities were significantly less likely than their counterparts in the higher level health facilities to provide specific advice. Conclusion: A significant proportion of women were not advised on recommended components of maternal and child health in rural India. Moreover, there were enormous socioeconomic inequalities. The findings of this study raise questions about the capacity of the public health care system in providing equitable services in India. The Government of India must focus on training and capacity building of the public health workers in communication skills so that they can deliver appropriate and recommended advice to all clients, irrespective of their socioeconomic status.

The methodology is then used to analyze the effects of Bangladesh\u2019s Lymphatic Filariasis Elimination Program, a disease-specific program, on the health system. Using difference-in-differences models and secondary data from population-based household surveys, this study compares changes over time in the utilization rates of eight essential health services and incidences of catastrophic health expenditures between individuals and households, respectively, of lymphatic filariasis hyper-endemic districts (treatment districts) and of hypo- and non-endemic districts (control districts). Utilization of all health services increased from year 2000 to year 2014 for the entire population but more so for the population living in treatment districts. However, when the services were analyzed individually, the difference-in-differences between the two populations was insignificant. Disadvantaged populations (i.e., populations that lived in rural areas, belonged to lower wealth quintiles, or did not attend school) were less likely to access essential health services. After five years of program interventions, households in control districts had a lower incidence of catastrophic health expenditures at several thresholds measured using total household expenditures and total non-food expenditures as denominators. Using essential health service coverage rates as outcome measures, the Lymphatic Filariasis Elimination Program cannot be said to have strengthened or weakened the health system. We can also say that there is a positive association between the Lymphatic Filariasis Elimination Program\u2019s interventions and lowered incidence of catastrophic health expenditures.\nAuthor summary: Evidence to understand the interactions between disease specific programs and the health system is insufficient and largely based on opinion. This study presents a methodology for using tracer indicators to measure the effect of a disease-specific program, the Bangladesh Lymphatic Filariasis Elimination Program, on its health system. The Composite Coverage Index and incidence of catastrophic health expenditures are well-established tracer indicators for measuring the strength of a health system. In this study, they were calculated, before the program started in 2000 and after it ended in 2015, using data from Demographic and Health Surveys and Household Income and Expenditure Surveys, respectively.

A multinomial logistic regression model with wealth/parity interaction was run and post-estimation margins analysis produced percentages of births for various combinations of wealth and parity for each survey. We found no reduction in inequity in this 25-year period. Among poorest women, lowest use of hospital-based childbirth (around 10%) was at high parity, with no change over time. In women having their first baby, hospital use increased over time but with a widening pro-rich gap (poorest women predicted use increased from 36 to 52% and richest from 40 to 59%).

Adverse social exposures in childhood can lead to chronic disorders later in life. Here, we sought to identify and evaluate the impact of social factors on child health in Ghana. As Ghana is unlikely to achieve the Millennium Development Goals\u2019 target of reducing child mortality by two-thirds between 1990 and 2015, we deemed it necessary to identify social determinants that might have contributed to the non-realisation of this goal. Methods: ScienceDirect, PubMed, MEDLINE via EBSCO and Google Scholar were searched for published articles reporting on the influence of social factors on child health in Ghana. After screening the 98 articles identified, 34 of them that met our inclusion criteria were selected for qualitative review. Results: Major social factors influencing child health in the country include maternal education, rural-urban disparities (place of residence), family income (wealth/poverty) and high dependency (multiparousity). These factors are associated with child mortality, nutritional status of children, completion of immunisation programmes, health-seeking behaviour and hygiene practices. Conclusions: Several social factors influence child health outcomes in Ghana. Developing more effective responses to these social determinants would require sustainable efforts from all stakeholders including the Government, healthcare providers and families. We recommend the development of interventions that would support families through direct social support initiatives aimed at alleviating poverty and inequality, and indirect approaches targeted at eliminating the dependence of poor health outcomes on social factors.

Triple (dis)advantage groups were based on wealth status, education status, and residence. The triple advantages variables specifically are urban residents, the educated, and those who belong to households of high wealth status, while the triple disadvantages are rural residents, the uneducated, and those who live in poor household wealth rank.

This study aims to assess the level and the distribution of child mortality outcomes in the Philippines across geographical and socioeconomic indicators. Methodology: Data on 159,130 children ever borne were analysed from five waves of the Philippine Demographic and Health Survey. Direct estimation was used to construct under-five and neonatal mortality rates for the period 1980\u20132013. Rate differences and ratios, and where possible, slope and relative indices of inequality were calculated to measure disparities on absolute and relative scales. Stratification was undertaken by levels of rural/urban location, island groups and household wealth. Findings: National under-five and neonatal mortality rates have shown considerable albeit differential reductions since 1980. Recently released data suggests that neonatal mortality has declined following a period of stagnation. Declines in under-five mortality have been accompanied by decreases in wealth and geography-related absolute inequalities. However, relative inequalities for the same markers have remained stable over time. For neonates, mixed evidence suggests that absolute and relative inequalities have remained stable or may have risen. Conclusion: In addition to continued reductions in under-five mortality, new data suggests that the Philippines have achieved success in addressing the commonly observed stagnated trend in neonatal mortality. This success has been driven by economic improvement since 2006 as well as efforts to implement a nationwide universal health care campaign. Yet, such patterns, nonetheless, accorded with persistent inequalities, particularly on a relative scale.

The purpose of this study was to assess if the Co-ordinated Approach To Community Health programme implemented by Sightsavers was successful in reaching the poorest population, women, and people living with disabilities in Kasungu district, Malawi. Methods: Between April and September 2017, data on socio-economic status, household characteristics and functional disability were collected from patients attending at eye camps in Kasungu district, Malawi. Using asset-based tools to measure household wealth (EquityTool\u00a9 and Simple Poverty Scorecard\u00a9) and the Washington Group Short Set of Questions, individuals were categorised by wealth quintiles, poverty status, and functional disability status and then compared to relevant representative national household surveys. In addition, a follow-up household survey was conducted to check the validity of self-reported household characteristics at eye camps. Results: A total of 1,358 individuals participated in the study. The study shows that self-reported data on household characteristics and assets are reliable and can be collected in clinical settings (instead of relying on direct observations of assets). Individuals attending outreach camps were poorer in terms of relative wealth and absolute poverty rates compared to the rest of the population in Kasungu. It was estimated that 9% of the participants belonged to the poorest quintile compared to 4% for the population in Kasungu (DHS 2015\u20132016).

The richest 10% of the population account for over half of global emissions, but the impacts of climate change will affect them the least. There is growing recognition that for climate action to be effective and equitable, wealth-based emissions inequalities must be addressed. Indeed, doing so would not only facilitate a just transition to net-zero, but accelerate it. In this article, we apply the concept of carbon capability to investigate the role that wealthy people play in the context of climate change\u00a0and explore opportunities for effective and equitable reductions in their emissions. We draw on a comprehensive, nationally representative survey of UK households with more than 300 measures and combine this with in-depth interviews with individuals defined as being amongst the wealthiest in the UK. Our findings indicate that besides their high consumption-based emissions, wealthy people possess several positive carbon capabilities compared to the rest of the population. These include the capacity to rapidly adopt low-carbon technologies, significant knowledge and awareness about climate change, and the ability to exert climate-positive influence amongst their social and professional networks. However, we also find little motivation amongst wealthy participants for reduced consumption, which they associate with lifestyle sacrifices and the loss of wellbeing. On this basis, we articulate how catalysing influence amongst wealthy people, associating low-carbon lifestyles with wellbeing, and promoting the adoption of low-carbon technologies can support emissions equity for net-zero. Using a carbon capability lens highlights how wealthy people contribute to climate change beyond their direct consumption behaviours, but also how existing capabilities may be leveraged for positive impact.\nAuthor summary: Using survey data and in-depth interviews with wealthy individuals, this research finds that despite their high consumption-based emissions, wealthy people have significant potential to drive effective and equitable climate action. However, the group often lack the motivation to do so. This study therefore suggests interventions encouraging wealthy individuals to leverage their influence for emissions reduction, linking low-carbon lifestyles with wellbeing, and supporting the adoption of low-carbon technologies.

We assessed the relationship between facilitated access to care and self-reported wellbeing outcomes. This cross-sectional telephone survey included cancer patients enrolled at BCCOE in March 2020. We used linear regression to compare six dimensions of quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30), depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), and financial toxicity (COST) among patients who did and did not receive facilitated access to care. We also assessed access to cancer care and whether patient wellbeing and its association with facilitated access to care differed by socioeconomic status. Of 214 respondents, 34.6% received facilitated access to care. Facilitated patients were more likely to have breast cancer and be on chemotherapy. Facilitation was significantly associated with more frequent in-person clinical encounters, improved perceived quality of cancer care, and reduced transportation-related barriers. Facilitated patients had significantly better global health status (\u03b2 = 9.14, 95% CI: 2.3, 16.0, p <0.01) and less financial toxicity (\u03b2 = 2.62, 95% CI: 0.2,5.0, p = 0.03). However, over half of patients reported missing or delaying appointment. Patient wellbeing was low overall and differed by patient socioeconomic status, with poor patients consistently showing worse outcomes. Socioeconomic status did not modify the association between facilitated access to care and wellbeing indicators. Further, facilitation did not lead to equitable wellbeing outcomes between richer and poorer patients. Facilitated access to care during COVID-19 pandemic was associated with some improvements in access to cancer care and patient wellbeing. However, cancer patients still experienced substantial disruptions to care and reported low overall levels of wellbeing, with socioeconomic disparities persisting despite facilitated access to care.

This study assessed the overall and sector-wise socioeconomic inequality in postnatal home visits made by Public Health Midwives (PHMs) in Sri Lanka and decomposed the observed socioeconomic inequality into potential determinants. Methods: Data from the Sri Lanka Demographic and Health Survey (SLDHS) 2006\u201307 were used. Data were collected from ever-married women who gave birth to their last child in 2001 or later (up to 2007). Whether the PHM visited the home to provide postnatal care within one month of the delivery was the health outcome of interest. Sri Lanka is divided into three sectors (areas) as urban, rural, and estate (plantation) based on the geographical location and the availability of infrastructure facilities. Concentration indices were calculated and concentration curves were plotted to quantify the overall and sector-wise socioeconomic inequality. Decomposition analysis using probit regression was performed to estimate the contribution of potential determinants to the observed socioeconomic inequality. Results: Overall, 83.0% of women were visited by a PHM within one month of the delivery. The highest number of home visits was reported in the rural sector (84.5%) and lowest was reported from the estate sector (72.4%). A pro-poor, pro-rich, and no inequality were observed across urban, rural, and estate sectors respectively. Wealth had a small contribution to the estimated inequality. Province of residence and the education level of women were the main determinants of the observed socioeconomic inequality. Conclusion: Addressing the socioeconomic inequality of postnatal home visits made by PHMs should not be seen as a health system issue alone. The associated social determinants of health should be addressed through a multi-sectoral approach encompassing the principles of primary health care.

It has been suggested that this is changing, with HIV prevalence falling among higher-educated groups while stable among lower-educated groups. A multi-country analysis has not been undertaken. Methods: We analysed data on socio-demographic factors and HIV infection from 14 nationally representative surveys of adults aged 15-24 (seven countries, two surveys each, 4-8 years apart). Sample sizes ranged from 2,408-12,082 (72,135 total). We used logistic regression to assess gender-stratified associations between highest educational level attended and HIV status in each survey, adjusting for age and urban/rural setting. We tested for interactions with urban/rural setting and age. Our primary hypothesis was that higher education became less of a risk factor for HIV over time. We tested for interaction between survey-year and the education-HIV association in each country and all countries pooled. Findings: In Ethiopia and Malawi, HIV prevalence was higher in more educated women in both surveys. In Lesotho, Kenya and Zimbabwe, HIV prevalence was lower in higher educated women in both surveys. In Ethiopia, HIV prevalence fell among no and secondary educated women only (interaction p<0\u00b701). Only among young men in Tanzania there was some evidence that the association between education and HIV changed over time (p=0\u00b707).

There is a paucity of evidence on the determinants of healthcare insurance coverage among women of reproductive age in Tanzania, therefore this study aimed at assessing factors associated with access to health care insurance among women of reproductive age in Tanzania using national Demographic and health survey dataset. Methodology: This study was an analytical cross-sectional study that utilized nationally representative secondary data sourced from the Tanzania Demographic and Health Surveys (TDHS) of 2022. A weighted sample of 15,254 women of reproductive age (15\u201349) was included in the study. A multilevel regression analysis was used to examine factors associated with health care insurance coverage. These results were presented using adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with a 95% confidence interval. Results: In Tanzania the proportion of health insurance coverage among women of reproductive age was 5.8% whereby majority of women subscribing to employer\u2019s insurance (3.9%). In the fixed effect model, older women (35\u201349) were more likely to be covered with health insurance compared those aged 15\u201324 (AOR = 2.75, 95% CI: 2.19, 3.45). Similarly, married women had higher likelihood of health insurance coverage compared to unmarried (AOR = 1.60, 95% CI: 1.33, 1.92). Furthermore, educated women were more likely to be covered with health insurance than uneducated women (AOR = 6.96, 95% CI: 4.74, 10.22).

Methods: Analysis illustrates on a cross-sectional household survey that followed multistage-cluster sampling. Concentration curve and indices were calculated. Binary logistic regression analysis was executed to account paternal factors associated with the utilization of maternal health services.

Critics argue that the high prices charged in the private sector limits the use of health care among the poorest, consequently reducing access and equity in the use of health care. Supporters argue that increased private sector participation might improve access and equity by bringing in much needed resources for health care and by allowing governments to increase focus on underserved populations. However, little empirical exists for or against either side of this debate. Methodology/Principal Findings: We examine the association between private sector participation and self-reported measures of utilization and equity in deliveries and treatment of childhood respiratory disease using regression analysis, across a sample of nationally-representative Demographic and Health Surveys from 34 SSA economies. We also examine the correlation between private sector participation and key background factors (socioeconomic development, business environment and governance) and use multivariate regression to control for potential confounders. Private sector participation is positively associated with greater overall access and reduced disparities between rich and poor as well as urban and rural populations. The positive association between private sector participation and improved health system performance is robust to controlling for confounders including per capita income and maternal education. Private sector participation is positively correlated with measures of socio-economic development and favorable business environment. Conclusions/Significance: Greater participation is associated with favorable intermediate outcomes in terms of access and equity.

Then, we outline the core principles of the measure, namely the relation to the capability approach, embedded equity considerations inspired by the fair-innings approach, and the bases for which capabilities should be considered. The aims were to 1) the most vital capabilities for individuals in Sweden, 2) to define a sufficient level of each identified capability to lead a flourishing life, and to 3) develop a complete questionnaire for the measurement of the identified capabilities. Material and methods: For the selection of capabilities, we used a Delphi process with Swedish civil society representants. To inform the questionnaire development, we conducted a web survey in three versions, with each Swedish 500 participants, to assess the distribution of capabilities that resulted from the Delphi process in the Swedish population. Each version was formulated with different strictness so that less strict wordings of a capability level would apply to a larger share of participants. All versions also included questions on inequality aversion regarding financial, educational, and health capabilities. Results: The Delphi process resulted in the following six capabilities: Financial situation & housing, health, social relations, occupations, security, and political & civil rights. We formulated the final phrasing for the questionnaire based on normative reasons and the distribution of capabilities in the population while taking into account inequality aversion. Conclusion: We developed a capability-based model for cost effectiveness economic evaluations of broader social consequences, specific to the Swedish context.

Well-established financial procedures appear to be complicated, and lead to partially biased results. Probability theory is applied, and the focus is on the finances of simple periodic growth processes, in the absence of intermediate divestments. The expected value of the profit rate, derived from accounting measures on an accrual basis, does not depend on the capitalization path. The expected value of capitalization is path dependent. Because of the path-dependent capitalization, the return rate on capital is path-dependent, and the time-average return rate on capital differs from the expected value of the return rate on capital for the growth cycle. The internal rate of return, defined through a compounding equation, is path-independent, thereby differing from the expected value of the rate of return on capital. It is shown that within a production estate, the area-average of internal rate of return is not representative of the rate of return on capital. The growth cycle length maximizing the return rate on equity is independent of market interest rate. Leverage effect enters the microeconomics of the growth processes through a separate leverage equation, where the leverage coefficient may reach positive or negative values. The leverage effect on the internal rate of return and the net present value are discussed. Both effects are solvable, resulting in incorrect estimates.\nAuthor Summary: Economics of periodic growth systems are investigated. In such systems, no time instant is of special importance, and expected values of observables within any period are of interest. The rate of return on capital (RROC), on an accrual basis, differs remarkably from the internal rate of return (IRR) on a cash flow basis. Both differ from the net present value of cash flows (NPV), which further depends on the selection of the \u201cpresent time\u201d. Suitable period durations do not depend on external interest rates. Leverage effects on RROC are successfully introduced, whereas both IRR and NPV fail to show a meaningful leverage effect.

The objective of this study is to assess demographic and socioeconomic determinants of current smoking in low- and middle-income countries. Methods: We used data, from the World Health Survey in 48 low-income and middle-income countries, to explore the impact of demographic and socioeconomic factors on the current smoking status of respondents. The data from these surveys provided information on 213,807 respondents aged 18 years or above that were divided into 4 pooled datasets according to their sex and country income group. The overall proportion of current smokers, as well as the proportion by each relevant demographic and socioeconomic determinant, was calculated within each of the pooled datasets, and multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the association between current smoking and these determinants. Results: The odds of smoking were not equal in all demographic or socioeconomic groups. Some factors were fairly stable across the four datasets studied: for example, individuals were more likely to smoke if they had little or no education, regardless of if they were male or female, or lived in a low or a middle income country. Nevertheless, other factors, notably age and wealth, showed a differential effect on smoking by sex or country income level. While women in the low-income country group were twice as likely to smoke if they were in the lowest wealth quintile compared with the highest, the association was absent in the middle-income country group. Conclusion: Information on how smoking is distributed among low- or middle-income countries will allow policy makers to tailor future policies, and target the most vulnerable populations.

Many studies that have estimated inequalities in diabetes make use of self-reported diabetes which is often biased by differences in access to health care and diabetes awareness. This study adds to this literature by making use of a more objective standardised measure of diabetes in South Africa. The study estimates socio-economic inequalities in undiagnosed diabetes, diagnosed diabetes (self-reported), as well as total diabetes (undiagnosed diabetics + diagnosed diabetics). The study also examines the contribution of lifestyle factors to diabetes inequalities in South Africa. Methods: This cross sectional study uses data from the 2012 South African National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (SANHANES-1) and applies the Erreygers Concentration Indices to assess socio-economic inequalities in diabetes. Contributions of lifestyle factors to inequalities in diabetes are assessed using a decomposition method. Results: Self-reported diabetes and total diabetes (undiagnosed diabetics + diagnosed diabetics) were significantly concentrated amongst the rich (CI = 0.0746; p < 0.05 and CI = 0.0859; p < 0.05). The concentration index for undiagnosed diabetes was insignificant but pro-poor. The decomposition showed that lifestyle factors contributed 22% and 35% to socioeconomic inequalities in self-reported and total diabetes, respectively. Conclusion: Diabetes in South Africa is more concentrated amongst higher socio-economic groups when measured using self-reported diabetes or clinical data. Our findings also show that the extent of inequality is worse in the total diabetes outcome (undiagnosed diabetics + diagnosed diabetics) when compared to the self-reported diabetes outcome. Although in comparison to other determinants, the contribution of lifestyle factors was modest, these contributions are important in the development of policies that address socio-economic inequalities in the prevalence of diabetes.

This study examines the effect of Ananya, a health system training and community outreach intervention, on reproductive, maternal and newborn health continuum of care (RMNH CoC) utilization in Bihar, India, and explores whether that effect is moderated by gender equity factors (child marriage, restricted mobility and low decision-making control). Methods: A two-armed quasi-experimental design compared districts in Bihar that did/did not implement Ananya. Cross-sections of married women aged 15\u201349 with a 0\u20135 month old child were surveyed at baseline and two year follow-up (baseline n = 7191 and follow-up n = 6143; response rates 88.9% and 90.7%, respectively). Difference-in-difference analyses assessed program impact on RMNH CoC co-coverage, defined by 9 health services/behaviors for the index pregnancy (e.g., antenatal care, skin-to-skin care). Three-way interactions assessed gender equity as a moderator of Ananya\u2019s impact. Findings: Participants reported low RMNH CoC co-coverage at baseline (on average 3.2 and 3.0 of the 9 RMNH services/behaviors for Ananya and control groups, respectively). The Ananya group showed a significantly greater increase in RMNH CoC co-coverage (.41 services) compared with the control group over time (p<0.001), with the primary drivers being increases in clean cord care, skin-to-skin care and postpartum contraceptive use. Gender equity interaction analyses revealed diminished intervention effects on antenatal care, skilled birth attendance and exclusive breastfeeding for women married as minors. Conclusion: Ananya improved RMNH CoC co-coverage among these recent mothers, largely through positive health behavior changes. Child marriage attenuated Ananya\u2019s impact on utilization of key health services and behaviors. Supporting the health system with training and community outreach can be beneficial to RMNH CoC utilization; additional support is needed to adequately address the unique issues faced by women married as minors.

Building on earlier scholarship that has tended to focus on specific forms of mortgages, we draw in this article on over 1.4 million diverse mortgage applications from the largest 100 U.S. metropolitan areas to interrogate racial/ethnic disparities for (1) all home types (mobile homes, condominiums, multi/single-family units), (2) all lien holders (private/government backed), (3) all purposes (vacation/rental/owner-occupied), and (4) all buyer loan sequences (purchase, refinance, home-equity/improvement). Our analyses, which make use of multilevel modeling, reveal durable inequalities for African Americans and Hispanics across time and advantages for Non-Hispanic White and Asian-American applicants. Such disadvantages are likewise observed for those seeking housing in highly concentrated minority locales, although such effects seem to vary by applicant race/ethnicity. Specifically, mortgage originations, while generally less likely in high minority concentrated areas, appear to be more likely for Black/Hispanic borrowers in areas that have been becoming increasingly minority concentrated.

The World Health Organization\u2019s Maternal Newborn Child and Adolescent Health (MNCAH) Policy Survey collects data on policies that have the potential to reduce maternal morbidity and mortality. The indicator, \u201cAre the following health services provided free of charge at point-of-use in the public sector for women of reproductive age?\u201d, captures the free provision of 13 key categories of maternal health-related services, to measure the success of UHC implementation with respect to maternal health. However, it is unknown whether it provides a valid measure of the provision of free care. Therefore, this study compared free maternal healthcare laws and policies against actual practice in three countries. Methods and findings: We conducted a cross-sectional study in four districts/provinces in Argentina, Ghana, and India. We performed desk reviews to identify free care laws and policies at the country level and compared those with reports at the global level. We conducted exit interviews with women aged 15\u201349 years who used a component service or their accompanying persons, as well as with facility chief financial officers or billing administrators, to determine if women had out-of-pocket expenditures associated with accessing services. For designated free services, prevalence of expenditures at the service level for women and reports by financial officers of women ever having expenditures associated with services designated as free were computed. These three sources of data (desk review, surveys of women and administrators) were triangulated, and chi-square analysis was conducted to determine if charges were levied differentially by standard equity stratifiers. Designation of services as free matched what was reported in the MNCAH Policy Survey for Argentina and Ghana. In India, insecticide-treated bed nets and testing and treatment for syphilis were only designated as free for selected populations, differing from the WHO MNCAH Policy Survey. Among 1046, 923, and 1102 women and accompanying persons who were interviewed in Argentina, Ghana, and India, respectively, the highest prevalence of associated expenditures among women who received a component service in each setting was for cesarean section in Argentina (26%, 24/92); family planning in Ghana (78.4%, 69/88); and postnatal maternal care in India (94.4%, 85/90). The highest prevalence of women ever having out of pocket expenditures associated with accessing any free service reported by financial officers was 9.1% (2/22) in Argentina, 64.1% (93/145) in Ghana, and 29.7% (47/158) in India. Across the three countries, self-reports of out of pocket expenditures were significantly associated with district/province and educational status of women. Additionally, wealth quintile in Argentina and age in India were significantly associated with women reporting out of pocket expenditures. Conclusions: Free care laws were largely accurately reported in the global MNCAH policy database. Notably, we found that women absorbed both direct and indirect costs and made both formal and informal payments for services designated as free. Therefore, the policy indicator does not provide a valid reflection of UHC in the three settings.

Methods and Findings: We conducted a cross-sectional study using data from a household survey of 15,698 members of 4,209 randomly-selected households in 7 provinces, which were representative of the provinces along the north side of the Yellow River. Interviews were conducted face-to-face and in Mandarin. Our analytic sample included 9,762 respondents from 2,642 households. In each household, respondents indicated the type of health insurance benefit that the household had (coverage for inpatient care only or coverage for both inpatient and outpatient care) and the number of outpatient visits in the 30 days preceding the interview and the number of hospitalizations in the 365 days preceding the household interview. People who had both outpatient and inpatient coverage compared with inpatient coverage only had significantly more village-level outpatient visits, township-level outpatient visits, and total outpatient visits. Furthermore, the increased utilization of township and village-level outpatient care was experienced disproportionately by people who were poorer, whereas the increased inpatient utilization overall and at the county level was experienced disproportionately by people who were richer. Conclusion: The evidence from this study indicates that the design of health insurance benefits is an important policy tool that can affect the health services utilization and socioeconomic equity in service use at different levels.

Materials and methods: We analysed cross-sectional data of 307,611 reproductive-aged women from the most recent demographic and health surveys of 24 sub-Saharan African countries. Bivariable and multivariable analyses were performed using chi-square test of independence and multi-level logistic regression respectively. Results are presented as adjusted Odds Ratios (aOR) for the multilevel logistic regression analysis. Statistical significance was set at p<0.05. Results: The overall coverage of health insurance was 8.5%, with cross-country variations. The lowest coverage was recorded in Chad (0.9%) and the highest in Ghana (62.4%). Individual-level factors significantly associated with health insurance coverage included age, place of residence, level of formal education, frequency of reading newspaper/magazine and watching television. Wealth status and place of residence were the contextual factors significantly associated with health insurance coverage. Women with no formal education were 78% less likely to be covered by health insurance (aOR = 0.22, 95% CI = 0.21\u20130.24), compared with those who had higher education.
